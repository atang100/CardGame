# CardGame

Constructors/Extraction Operator are more or less complete but completely untested.
Compiles at least

### Card Hierarchy (In-progress)
- done?
- can all methods be const?
- card desstructor needs to be virtual so that sub-classes are destructed properly

### Chain (In-progress)
- I feel like this will be buggy

### Chain_Base (DONE)
- Pretty sure nothing needs to be done here

### Deck (In-progress)

### DiscardPile (Done, Need to Test)

### TradeArea (In-progress)

### Hand (In-progress)

### Player (In-progress)
- fix constructor

### Table (In-progress)
- no functions have been implemented.

### CardFactory (In-progress)
- destructor not done (needs to destroy all cards)

### Pseudo Code (In-progress)
- 3 txt files will be needed: player1, player2, and game
- need to implement game loop
