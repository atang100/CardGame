# CardGame

## TODO

### Card Hierarchy (In-progress)
- done?
- can all methods be const?
- card desstructor needs to be virtual so that sub-classes are destructed properly

### Chain (In-progress)
- implement constructor
- I feel like this will be buggy

### Chain_Base (DONE)
- Pretty sure nothing needs to be done here

### Deck (In-progress)
- implement constructor

### DiscardPile (Done, Need to Test)

### TradeArea (In-progress)
- constructor incomplete

### Hand (In-progress)
- implement constructor

### Player (In-progress)
- Missing constructor used to resume game.

### Table (In-progress)
- no functions have been implemented.

### CardFactory (In-progress)
- destructor not done (needs to destroy all cards)

### Pseudo Code (In-progress)
- need to implement game loop
